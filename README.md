Summary of Employee Management System Implementation
<br>
The Employee Management System is a web application that allows users to manage employee records efficiently. It enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update) operations on employee data, which is stored in a JSON file. The application is built using Node.js and Express for the backend, while the frontend utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction.

Key Functionalities
View Employees:

Upon loading the application, all employee records are fetched from the server and displayed in a tabular format.
Each record shows the employee's name, role, and provides an option to edit the employee.
Add New Employee:
<br>
Users can input a new employee's name and role, which is then sent to the server to be added to the JSON file.
The UI is updated dynamically to reflect the new employee without reloading the page.
Edit Employee:
<br>
Users can edit an employee's role by clicking the "Edit" button, which prompts for a new role.
The updated role is sent to the server, and upon successful update, the UI reflects the change immediately.
Implementation Details
Backend (Node.js + Express):
<br>
The server serves static files and handles API requests for managing employees.
Data is read from and written to a JSON file, which acts as a simple database.
The API endpoints include:
GET /employees: Fetch all employee records.
POST /add-employee: Add a new employee.
PUT /update-employee: Update an existing employee's role.
Frontend (HTML + CSS + JavaScript):
<br>
The HTML structure includes a table to display employee data and buttons for each employee to edit their records.
JavaScript functions handle user interactions and communicate with the backend using the fetch API to perform CRUD operations without reloading the page.
Dynamic updates to the UI are handled using DOM manipulation.<br>
Technologies Used <br>
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
Express: Framework for building web applications and APIs.
HTML/CSS: Structure and style of the web pages.
JavaScript: Client-side scripting for interactive elements and API calls.
JSON: Lightweight data format for storing employee records. <br>
Conclusion<br>
The Employee Management System provides a robust platform for managing employee data effectively. The integration of dynamic frontend operations with a straightforward backend API allows users to seamlessly interact with employee records, ensuring a smooth user experience. This project can be further enhanced by implementing features such as user authentication, data validation, and improved UI design.
